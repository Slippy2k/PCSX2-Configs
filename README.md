These are configuration files to be used in conjunction with the PS2 emulator [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) and the [PCSX2 Configurator](https://github.com/roguesaloon/launchbox-plugin_pcsx2-configurator) plugin for [Launchbox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/). These require **PCSX2 1.5.0 or higher** to function properly. You can find the latest development builds (1.5.0) available [here](https://pcsx2.net/download/development.html).

The configurations have been tested and created on a mid-range PC (Win 7/64-bit, i7 4770k, GTX 780, 32GB RAM) and are designed to eliminate as many problems and visual errors as possible, while still upscaling (by 4x generally) wherever possible.

An extensive spreadsheet covering the specifics of each config and detailing issues present (if any) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sC19l0htx0Qu2QE1CFta5R35iqPBN332dCHfTg1BGlQ/edit?usp=sharing).
